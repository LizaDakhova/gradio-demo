___
Gradio is a powerful tool that is used to create machine learning model user interfaces. It is a python package that is perfectly compatible with several machine learning frameworks such as PyTorch and TensorFlow. It can also be used to create UIs around arbitrary general-purpose Python scripts.

The popularity of Gradio is increasing rapidly. It is being used by machine learning labs at large companies like Cisco and Amazon, as well as academic settings like Stanford medicine.

**Pros:**
* Gradio offers several customizable UI components that are optimized for machine learning models. For example, Gradio provides easy-to-use drag-and-drop image classification that is highly optimized for the user.
* It is very easy and fast to set up Gradio. It can be installed directly through pip. Moreover, creating interfaces in Gradio requires only a couple of lines of code.
* Gradio creates shareable links which are probably the fastest way to get a deployed machine learning in front of users
* Unlike the other packages, Gradio can be run anywhere from within a Jupyter/Colab notebook or a standalone Python script.

**Cons:**
* Though Gradio has good documentation on the official website, it is hard to find information and enough examples about the specific features that it offers.
* Gradio has a smaller community than some of the other packages, making it harder to find resources about it.
* Gradio is specific towards building UIs for machine learning models, and less towards dashboards.
